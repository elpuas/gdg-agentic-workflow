# Project: Static Website – Personal Portfolio

This project is a simple static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s intended to serve as a personal portfolio to showcase basic information, links, and projects.

## Project structure

- `/index.html`: Homepage
- `/about.html`: About me page
- `/projects.html`: Project listing
- `/style.css`: General styles
- `/main.js`: Basic JavaScript (menu toggle, scroll-to-top)

## AI agent objective

This agent should:

1. Read this context when triggered.
2. Suggest a commit message based on the files that were changed.
3. Identify possible improvements such as:
   - Adding semantic structure to the HTML
   - Documenting JS functions
   - Separating repeated CSS styles
   - Improving code organization

## Commit message convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

- `feat:` for new sections or features
- `fix:` for code issues or bugs
- `style:` for visual or CSS-related improvements
- `refactor:` for code restructuring without functional changes

## Notes

- This is a fully static site, no backend involved.
- We aim for clean, well-commented, and easy-to-maintain code.
